# Story Continuation

Generate and evaluate coherent, engaging story continuations that maintain narrative consistency, address all story elements, and conclude with powerful theme elevation.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Analyze the Given Story

Extract and understand:
- **Characters**: Protagonists, relationships, motivations, roles (主角、配角戏份)
  - Protagonist profile: Age, background, abilities, limitations
  - Character desires: What they want vs. what they need
  - Internal conflicts: Fears, doubts, contradictions
  - Relationships: Dynamics with other characters (e.g., George-David, George-Father, George-Coach)
- **Setting**: Time, place, atmosphere (环境描写)
- **Conflict**: Central problem, personal vs. collective dilemma (核心冲突)
- **Themes**: Core message about success, cooperation, values (主题内涵)
  - Personal achievement vs. Team success
  - Individual glory vs. Collective honor
  - Family legacy and expectations
- **Foreshadowing**: Elements requiring resolution (伏笔铺垫)
  - Character traits mentioned (e.g., consistent practice, determination)
  - Unresolved tensions (e.g., father's regret, record vs. victory)
  - Symbolic objects or repeated patterns
- **Language style**: Tone, narrative techniques, rhetorical devices (语言特点)
  - Narrative perspective (typically third-person focused on protagonist)
  - Sentence structure variety
  - Use of internal monologue, dialogue, description

### 2. Process Continuation Requirements

When given beginning sentences:

1. **Identify constraints**:
   - Given opening sentences (段首句)
   - Number of paragraphs required
   - Word count requirements (typically 150 words per paragraph)
   - Theme expectations

2. **Map paragraph transitions**:
   - Paragraph 1 ending → Paragraph 2 opening connection
   - Ensure logical flow and coherence (衔接性)
   - Plan how given opening sentence naturally follows previous paragraph

### 3. Create Guiding Questions

Follow this pattern for each paragraph:

**Paragraph [N]: [Opening sentence]**
- **段落背景 (Setting)**: Where/when does this take place? Duration of scene?
- **段首衔接 (Opening connection)**: Why this situation? Character thoughts/feelings/actions?
- **情节推进 (Plot progression)**: How does situation develop? Character responses?
- **段间衔接 (Paragraph transition)**: What leads to next paragraph's opening?

For final paragraph, replace 段间衔接 with:
- **续写结尾 (Story conclusion)**: Resolution? Character growth? Final realization?
- **主题升华 (Theme elevation)**: What lasting truth does the protagonist understand?

### 4. Track Emotional Arcs

Map character emotional journeys:
- **Starting state** → **Catalyst** → **Struggle** → **Decision** → **Resolution**
- Show internal conflict through actions and dialogue
- Ensure emotional changes are motivated and believable

**Example Emotional Arc (George's story)**:
- **Paragraph 1**: Confidence → Doubt → Internal struggle → Decision to trust team
- **Paragraph 2**: Anticipation → Joy (team success) → Profound realization → Peace

### 5. Generate the Continuation

#### Content Requirements (What)

**Theme Alignment**:
- Maintain consistency with original story values
- Address personal vs. collective honor conflicts
- Show character growth and realization
- Reflect positive values (正确的价值观)
- **Conclude with theme elevation sentence** (主题升华句)

**Plot Development**:
- **Completeness** (完整性): Resolve core conflicts
- **Rationality** (合理性): Follow logical progression, no violations of established facts
- **Coherence** (衔接性): Smooth transitions between sections
- **Innovation** (创新性): Creative yet consistent solutions

#### Method Requirements (How)

**Narrative Techniques**:
- **Environment description** (环境描写): Create vivid scenes with sensory details
- **Internal monologue** (内心独白): Show character's thought process
- **Character dialogue** (人物对话): Reveal relationships and emotions
- **Flashback/foreshadowing** (插叙): Connect to earlier story elements
- **Sensory details** (感官细节): Engage multiple senses
- **Theme elevation structures** (主题升华句结构): Crystallize story message

**Language Quality**:
- **Correctness** (正确性): Grammar, tense consistency, proper collocations
- **Richness** (丰富性): Varied sentence structures, diverse vocabulary
- **Appropriateness** (得体性): Match original style, natural expressions
- **Fluency** (流畅性): Logical flow, smooth transitions

### 6. Craft Theme Elevation Sentence

End your story with a powerful thematic conclusion using patterns from [references/theme-elevation.md](references/theme-elevation.md).

**Quick formulas**:
- **Lasting impact**: "Though [temporary thing] would fade, what it taught [protagonist] about [lesson] would remain forever."
- **First realization**: "For the first time since [beginning], [protagonist] felt [emotion], understanding that [truth]."
- **Transformation**: "Looking at [object/scene], [protagonist] felt [old feeling] fading, replaced by [new understanding]."
- **True definition**: "It dawned on [protagonist] that true [success/victory] isn't [misconception]; it's [true understanding]."

### 7. Quality Evaluation

Use evaluation criteria from [references/evaluation-criteria.md](references/evaluation-criteria.md)

## Application Example: George's Basketball Story

### Story Analysis

**Core Conflict**: George can break his father's scoring record (personal achievement) OR pass to teammate for team victory (collective honor). History repeating: father's team lost despite his record.

**Key Characters**:
- **George**: Team leader, skilled player, carries father's legacy
- **David**: Trusted teammate, open for shot
- **Father**: Former star, regrets personal glory over team loss
- **Coach**: Emphasizes team unity

**Foreshadowing to Address**:
- Father's regret: "I would have traded every shot for a win"
- Coach's reminder: Team unity matters most
- George's leadership qualities
- David's role as supportive teammate

### Guiding Questions

**Paragraph 1: "However, his team was now one point behind the Lions."**
- **段落背景**: Final moments of championship game, clock ticking down
- **段首衔接**: Why one point behind? George's internal conflict about record vs. team
- **情节推进**: George recalls father's words, sees David open, makes decision
- **段间衔接**: George passes ball to David (leads to paragraph 2)

**Paragraph 2: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot at the basket."**
- **段落背景**: Critical moment, ball in air, entire gym watching
- **段首衔接**: David's shot attempt, tension in air
- **情节推进**: Ball goes through hoop, team wins, celebration
- **续写结尾**: George's realization about true victory, team celebration
- **主题升华**: Understanding that team success > personal records

### Example Continuation

**Paragraph 1**:
However, his team was now one point behind the Lions. The clock showed fifteen seconds—enough time for one final play. George's hands gripped the ball, his father's record just two points away. The crowd's roar faded as his father's words echoed in his mind: "I would have traded every shot for a win." Sweat dripped down his temple as two Lions players closed in, their arms raised high. George's eyes darted across the court and locked onto David, standing open near the three-point line. In that split second, George understood what his father had learned thirty years too late. With a swift pivot, he launched the ball toward his teammate.

**Paragraph 2**:
With no defenders around, David turned and shot at the basket. Time seemed to suspend as the ball arced through the air, spinning in perfect rotation. The gymnasium held its collective breath. Then—swish! The net rippled as the ball dropped through, and the buzzer sounded. The Bears had won by two points! George's teammates swarmed the court, lifting David onto their shoulders as the crowd erupted. George felt his father's hand on his shoulder, pride gleaming in his eyes. Though George's name wouldn't top the scoring record, something far more valuable settled in his chest. For the first time, he truly understood: true victory isn't measured in personal glory but in the courage to lift your team when it matters most—a lesson that would guide him far beyond any basketball court.

6. **过度戏剧化 (Over-dramatization)**: Unrealistic reactions
