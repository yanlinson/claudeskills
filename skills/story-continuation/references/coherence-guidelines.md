# Coherence Guidelines (连贯性指南)

## Understanding Coherence in Story Continuation

**Coherence** is the quality that makes a story flow smoothly and logically from one part to another. In story continuation, coherence operates at multiple levels:

1. **Macro-level**: Overall story logic and theme consistency
2. **Paragraph-level**: Flow between original text and continuations
3. **Sentence-level**: Smooth transitions between individual sentences
4. **Word-level**: Appropriate use of transition words and pronouns

## Paragraph-to-Paragraph Coherence

### Transition Techniques

#### 1. Causal Links (因果联系)
Previous action causes next event.

**Structure**:
- P1 ends with action/decision
- P2 begins with consequence

**Examples**:
- P1: "With a swift pivot, he launched the ball toward his teammate."
- P2: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot at the basket."
- **Link**: George's pass enables David's shot

**Markers**:
- As a result
- Consequently  
- Therefore
- Because of this
- This led to

#### 2. Temporal Progression (时间推进)
Clear time movement from one event to next.

**Techniques**:
- Sequential time markers
- Action progression
- Natural time flow

**Examples**:
- P1: "George made his decision in that split second."
- P2: "Moments later, the ball sailed through the air."

**Markers**:
- Then
- Next
- Moments later
- Immediately
- As soon as
- Meanwhile
- At the same time

#### 3. Emotional Bridge (情感桥梁)
Feeling at end of P1 carries to P2.

**Structure**:
- P1 ends with emotional state
- P2 continues or transforms that emotion

**Examples**:
- P1: "Hope surged through George as he released the ball."
- P2: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot, carrying that hope forward."

**Techniques**:
- Emotion words repeated or evolved
- Physical manifestations continue
- Emotional arc maintained

#### 4. Spatial Movement (空间转移)
Physical journey from one location to next.

**Structure**:
- P1 establishes position/movement
- P2 continues spatial progression

**Examples**:
- P1: "George's eyes locked onto David across the court."
- P2: "With no defenders around, David [already positioned] turned and shot."

**Markers**:
- Across
- Nearby
- In the distance
- Closer
- Away from

#### 5. Thematic Echo (主题呼应)
Idea introduced in P1 developed in P2.

**Structure**:
- P1 introduces concept
- P2 develops or resolves it

**Examples**:
- P1: "George remembered his father's words about true victory."
- P2: "...he truly understood: true victory isn't measured in personal glory."

**Techniques**:
- Repeat key words with new meaning
- Develop metaphor
- Answer question posed
- Fulfill promise made

### Common Coherence Errors

#### 1. Logic Gaps (逻辑断层)
Missing steps in cause-effect chain.

**Problem Example**:
- P1: "George held the ball, unsure what to do."
- P2: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot."
- **Gap**: How did David get the ball?

**Solution**:
- P1: "George held the ball, then spotted David open. With a swift pass, he sent the ball flying."
- P2: "With no defenders around, David caught the pass, turned and shot."

**Prevention**:
- Map cause-effect chain
- Don't skip crucial steps
- Make actions explicit
- Show how situation changes

#### 2. Time Jumps (时间跳跃)
Unexplained temporal leaps.

**Problem Example**:
- P1: "The clock showed fifteen seconds remaining."
- P2: "After the game, everyone celebrated."
- **Gap**: What happened in those fifteen seconds?

**Solution**:
- P1: "The clock showed fifteen seconds remaining... [events]"
- P2: "The buzzer sounded. The game was over. Now everyone celebrated."

**Prevention**:
- Track time explicitly
- Use time markers
- Don't skip crucial moments
- Show key events in real time

#### 3. Character Teleportation (人物瞬移)
Unclear spatial transitions.

**Problem Example**:
- P1: "George stood at center court."
- P2: "David, now under the basket, shot the ball."
- **Gap**: How did David get there? Where's George?

**Solution**:
- P1: "George stood at center court. He spotted David cutting toward the basket."
- P2: "David, now under the basket after his quick move, caught the pass and shot."

**Prevention**:
- Track character positions
- Show movement explicitly
- Maintain spatial awareness
- Use position markers

#### 4. Emotional Whiplash (情绪突变)
Unmotivated mood changes.

**Problem Example**:
- P1: "George felt crushing disappointment."
- P2: "Suddenly, George was overjoyed."
- **Gap**: What caused the change?

**Solution**:
- P1: "George felt crushing disappointment as his shot missed."
- P2: "But then David grabbed the rebound and scored. Relief and joy flooded through George."

**Prevention**:
- Show emotional catalysts
- Transition emotions gradually
- Use physical cues
- Make changes believable

#### 5. Dropped Threads (线索丢失)
Introduced elements never resolved.

**Problem Example**:
- P1: "George remembered his father's disappointed face."
- P2: [Father never mentioned again]
- **Gap**: Father's reaction to outcome?

**Solution**:
- P2: "George felt his father's hand on his shoulder, pride gleaming in his eyes."

**Prevention**:
- List all introduced elements
- Ensure each is addressed
- Tie up loose ends
- Complete character arcs

## Beginning Sentence Integration

### Smooth Integration Strategies

#### 1. Natural Flow
Make the given sentence feel inevitable.

**Technique**:
- Build toward given sentence in previous paragraph
- Create situation that necessitates it

**Example**:
- Given P2 opening: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot."
- P1 ending setup: "George passed the ball to David, who stood alone near the basket."
- **Result**: P2 opening feels natural and expected

#### 2. Contextual Grounding
Quickly establish where/when.

**Technique**:
- Use first 2-3 sentences after given opening
- Establish time, place, atmosphere
- Orient reader immediately

**Example**:
- Given: "However, his team was now one point behind the Lions."
- Add context: "However, his team was now one point behind the Lions. The clock showed fifteen seconds—enough time for one final play. The crowd's roar faded as George gripped the ball."
- **Result**: Reader knows when, where, what's at stake

#### 3. Character Positioning
Clear who is where and why.

**Technique**:
- Establish character locations
- Show relationships spatially
- Explain positions logically

**Example**:
- Given: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot."
- Position clearly: "With no defenders around—they'd all converged on George—David turned and shot."
- **Result**: Reader understands spatial dynamics

#### 4. Emotional Continuity
Maintain emotional thread.

**Technique**:
- Carry emotion from previous paragraph
- Show emotion through action
- Develop emotional arc

**Example**:
- P1 ends with: "Hope surged through George."
- P2 given opening: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot."
- Add emotion: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot, carrying forward the hope George had placed in him."

#### 5. Action Momentum
Keep story moving forward.

**Technique**:
- Given sentence advances plot
- Follow with immediate consequences
- Maintain pacing

**Example**:
- Given: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot."
- Maintain momentum: "With no defenders around, David turned and shot. The ball arced through the air. Time seemed to freeze."

#### Synonymy
Use synonyms to vary language while maintaining connection.

**Technique**:
- Replace with similar meaning words
- Vary to avoid repetition
- Maintain conceptual link

**Example**:

### Grammatical Cohesion (语法衔接)

#### Reference
Use pronouns and demonstratives effectively.

**Pronouns**:
- He, she, it, they
- His, her, its, their
- This, that, these, those

**Rules**:
- Clear antecedents
- Avoid ambiguity
- Use for smooth flow

**Example**:

**Example**:
- "George could shoot, but he chose not to **do so**."

#### Ellipsis
Omit repeated elements.

**Technique**:
- Remove redundant words
- Maintain clarity
- Create tighter prose

**Example**:
- Full: "George passed the ball and David caught the ball."
- Ellipsis: "George passed the ball and David caught [it]."

#### Conjunction
Use connecting words effectively.

**Types**:
- **Additive**: and, also, furthermore
- **Adversative**: but, however, yet
- **Causal**: so, therefore, because
- **Temporal**: then, next, meanwhile

**Example**:

- **Connection**: Sound thread continues

### Coherence Through Structure

#### Parallel Structure
Use similar grammatical patterns.

**Technique**:
- Match sentence structures
- Create rhythm
- Emphasize connections

**Example**:
- "George could **chase glory**. He could **break the record**. Or he could **choose his team**."

#### Circular Structure
End where you began, transformed.

**Technique**:

- Create satisfaction

**Example**:
- Opening: "George stood outside the gym, determined to make history."
- Closing: "George walked out of the gym, having made history—just not the kind he'd expected."
