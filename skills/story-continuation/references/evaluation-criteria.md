## Sample Evaluation (评分示例)

### Example: George's Basketball Story

**Sample Continuation A** (Excellent - 24/25):

*Paragraph 1*: However, his team was now one point behind the Lions. The clock showed fifteen seconds—enough time for one final play. George's hands gripped the ball, his father's record just two points away. The crowd's roar faded as his father's words echoed in his mind: "I would have traded every shot for a win." Sweat dripped down his temple as two Lions players closed in, their arms raised high. George's eyes darted across the court and locked onto David, standing open near the three-point line. In that split second, George understood what his father had learned thirty years too late. With a swift pivot, he launched the ball toward his teammate.

*Paragraph 2*: With no defenders around, David turned and shot at the basket. Time seemed to suspend as the ball arced through the air, spinning in perfect rotation. The gymnasium held its collective breath. Then—swish! The net rippled as the ball dropped through, and the buzzer sounded. The Bears had won by two points! George's teammates swarmed the court, lifting David onto their shoulders as the crowd erupted. George felt his father's hand on his shoulder, pride gleaming in his eyes. Though George's name wouldn't top the scoring record, something far more valuable settled in his chest. For the first time, he truly understood: true victory isn't measured in personal glory but in the courage to lift your team when it matters most—a lesson that would guide him far beyond any basketball court.

George decided to pass the ball to David instead of shooting himself. This was a hard decision but he thought it was the right thing to do.

*Paragraph 2*: With no defenders around, David turned and shot at the basket. The ball went into the basket and everyone was very happy. The team won the game. George felt good about his decision. He learned that teamwork is more important than personal achievement. His father was proud of him.
